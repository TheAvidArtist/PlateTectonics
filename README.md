## Introduction



This report is about mapping earthquakes from 2010 to present along the Pacific Northwest coast.  The Juan de Fuca plate causes three types of faults (convergent, divergent, and transform) of which we observed two (divergent and transform).  We observed the change in magnitude and location with time and graphed the results.

## Maps and Graphs


From this scatter plot of magnitude vs time of all the earthquakes in the region we can see that it is a fairly even spread of magnitude and frequency of earthquakes across time:

Earthquake locations on a map with radius and color of circles correlated to the magnitude of the earthquake show that nearly all the earthquakes occur on the fault lines on the Juan de Fuca plate:

Earthquake locations on a map with radius and color of circles correlated to the magnitude of the earthquake in relation to the Juan de Fuca plate for clarity:

We can see the most earthquake data along the bottom of the Juan de Fuca plate on the Divergent plate boundary.  Nearly all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries and faults because that is where the tectonic plates are stressed.  At divergent boundaries, new material is created at the surface as plates move apart and shallow earthquakes are common.  At transform boundaries, plates move past each other and earthquakes often occur from strike-slip faulting and friction.  Here is a heat map showing the frequency of earthquakes:

## Earthquake data


The range of earthquake size and the average earthquake size in the divergent region is:

Max: 6.6

Min: 2.5

Average: 2.97

and in the transform region is:

Max: 5.6

Min: 2.5

Average: 3.41

and overall is: 

Max: 6.8

Min: 2.5

Average: 3.18



## What happened in April 2015


Map of earthquakes in April 2015:

Most of the earthquakes occured 300 miles off the Pacific Northwest coast on the Axial Seamount, which corresponds to when volcanoes started erupting off the Oregon coast (which actually occured over 5 months).  We can see from this time plot that a good portion of the earthquakes happened on one day:

## Divergent and Transform Boundaries



Earthquakes across the divergent boundary:

Earthquakes across the transform boundary:

![Fig8](https://github.com/TheAvidArtist/PlateTectonics/blob/master/TransformBoundary.PNG)




We can see that there are a lot more earthquakes occuring along the divergent boundary, but they are deeper near the transform boundary.  If we compare the two boundaries in terms of magnitude and time, they seem to have a fairly even spread across both of them, but the transform boundary has higher magnitude earthquakes on average and there are more frequent earthquakes along the divergent boundary.

## Conclusions

We can clearly see from all the data that the most earthquakes occur along the Juan de Fuca plate boundary.  More earthquakes occur along the Divergent boundary but higher magnitude earthquakes occur along the Transform boundary.  The range of magnitude of earthquakes on the Divergent boundary is from 2.5 to 6.6 and the range of magnitude of earthquakes on the Transform boundary is from 2.5 to 5.6. During April 2015, we can see a spike in earthquakes because of the Axial Seamount volcano eruptions.
