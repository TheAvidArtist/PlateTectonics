## Plate Tectonics

## Introduction

This report is about mapping earthquakes from 2010 to present along the Juan de Fuca plate.

A scatter plot of magnitude vs time of all the earthquakes in the region:

We can see the most earthquake data along the bottom of the Juan de Fuca plate on the Divergent plate boundary.  Earthquakes occur more often at divergent plate boundaries because as a new crust is created, the other crust is pushed apart, causing cracks and forming faults, which is how earthquakes happen.


The range of earthquake size and the average earthquake size in the divergent region is:
Max: 6.6
Min: 2.5
Average: 2.97

and in the transform region is:
Max: 5.6
Min: 2.5
Average: 3.41

and overall is: 
Max: 6.8
Min: 2.5
Average: 3.18


Map of earthquakes in April 2015:

Most of the earthquakes occured 300 miles off the Pacific Northwest cost on the Axial Seamount, which corresponds to when volcanoes started erupting off the Oregon coast (which actually occured over 5 months).
